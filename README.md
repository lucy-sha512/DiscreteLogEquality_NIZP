# Discrete Log Equality Non Interactive Zero Knowledge proof
This is a python implementation of Non interactive Zero knowledge proof for Discrete Log Equality on Elliptic NISTP256 curve.
Given two public keys A=Gx and B=Mx with  as the secret, the Prover proves his knowledge of x without revealing x.
